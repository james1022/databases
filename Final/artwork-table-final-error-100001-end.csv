January 18 |  1925 in Chicago |  Illinois) is an American graphics designer and the designer of the Playboy bunny.  Paul studied at the Art Institute of Chicago (1940-1943) and at the Institute of Design [Illinois Institute of Technology](1946-1950). He was working as a freelance designer when he in 1953 was contacted by playboy founder Hugh Hefner who needed a logo for his new magazine. He created the now famous rabbit wearing a tuxedo bow tie. Paul went on to design the whole first edition of the magazine and was hired by Hefner as Playboy's first art director in 1954 |  a position he held for 30 years.  In 1986 Paul was elected to the Hall of Fame of the Art Directors Club of New York.  one lithograph |  offset printed,47,31.5,null,Linda Barth Goldstein Fund,Print,Prints & Illustrated Books,2006,N,103561
